# showmap
Fork of pwar's aardwolf showmap plugin to allow for getting updated map lists

### Installation
Extract the contents of the zip file directly to your plugins folder. Go to the plugins menu and install/reinstall the showmap plugin.

### Updating maps
Run `showmap update` to pull the up-to-date maps list from the [boot site](https://aardwolfboot.com/maps/). This only really needs to be done if you notice new maps added to the boot site that aren't showing up in the plugin.
